# 2D-Shape-Extrusion-Manipulation

**Goal:** <br />
1.Use Babylon.js to create a 3D scene with a ground plane.
2.Implement functionality to allow the user to draw 2D shapes on the ground plane using mouse interactions.
3.Once the shape is completed (a closed loop), provide a UI element (e.g., button) to initiate the extrusion process.
4.Allow the user to move the extruded objects on the ground plane using mouse interactions.
5.Implement functionality to edit the vertices of the extruded object using mouse interactions.
6.Provide visual cues and UI elements to indicate the selected object and active editing mode.

**Features:** <br />
1. A 3D scene with a ground plane.
2. Functionality to allow the user to draw 2D shapes on the ground plane using mouse interactions <br />
                ..* left-click to add points
                ..*right-click to complete the shape
                ..*Draw button to enter the draw mode
3. Extrude button to initiate the extrusion of 2D Closed loop polygons to a height of 5 units.
4. Move button to perform movement of extruded shapes on the ground plane using click and drag.
5. Edit button to edit the vertices of the extruded object using click and drag.
6. Visual cues and UI elements to indicate the selected object and active editing mode.

**How To run the application:**
1. Clone the repository to your local
2. Run the HTML file to view it on your web browser

**A glimpse into the Application:**
1. 3D scene with Ground plane


2. Drawing 2D Shapes


3. Extrusion of 2D shapes to 3D


4. Movement of extruded polygons with visual cues

5. Movement of Vertices of the extruded polygons
